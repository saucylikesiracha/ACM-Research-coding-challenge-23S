The way I would determine what the most common star type is based off of the data is by looking at the temeprature and luminiosty values of each star type. If I find common values that are close to each other I can infer that the values that are similar to each other are a similar star type.
To answer the question what properties are the most influential in classifying a star's type, I would have to say that the temperature and the luminosity of each star are the mst influential properties in classifying a star's type. However another property which would be relatively influential in classifying a star's type is the star's radius. In terms of fnding the star with that is the hottest, I would look for the star with the highest temperature, because the higher the temperature the hotter the star is. I also noticed that the temoerature of the star does not correlate to the stars radius, but does correlate with the star's luminosity. Based off the data I can infer that the hotter the star the higher the luminosity is.
